            <h3>West Jefferson, NC Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>West Jefferson was incorporated in 1909. At one time, West Jefferson had the distinction of having the only cheese factory in the southeastern United States. For many decades, West Jefferson was served by the Norfolk and Western Railroad, better known as the 'Virginia Creeper'. The railroad was the primary reason for the creation of West Jefferson, as the town became a major stop on the railway. With the decline of the railroad and the loss of textile factory jobs to foreign markets, West Jefferson's economy is increasingly devoted to the tourism industry. The town's location in the Appalachian Mountains has led to many tourists visiting the area each year, and many out-of-state tourists have begun to build cabins and housing developments around the town. Attractions include a walkable main street with food, breweries, local art, a cheese factory, a vintage theater, an annual festival, a caboose from a train, and a children's playground.</p>
